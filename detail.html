      <h3>Puttasaamy case </h3> 
	The judgment contradicts all the arguments raised against the concept of privacy. While countering the submission that the constitution makers had rejected the concept of privacy, it has been held that:
“To live is to live with dignity.  The draftsmen of the constitution defined their vision of the society in which constitutional values would be attained by emphasising, among other freedoms, liberty and dignity… Dignity is the core which unites the fundamental rights because the fundamental rights seek to achieve for each individual the dignity of existence. Privacy with its attendant values assures dignity to the individual and it is only when life can be enjoyed with dignity can liberty be of true substance… The draftsmen of the constitution had a sense of history− both global and domestic– as they attempted to translate their vision of freedom into guarantees against authoritarian behaviour… The backdrop of human suffering furnished a reason to preserve a regime of governance based on the rule of law which would be subject to democratic accountability against a violation of fundamental freedoms… Hence, it would be an injustice both to the draftsmen of the constitution as well as to the document which they sanctified by constricting its interpretation to an originalist interpretation.”
The judgment makes it clear that privacy is “not an elitist construct”. The judgment has rejected the argument of the attorney general that right to privacy must be forsaken in the interest of welfare entitlements provided by the state. The judgment says:
“The refrain that the poor need no civil and political rights and are concerned only with economic well-being has been utilised though history to wreak the most egregious violations of human rights. Above all, it must be realised that it is the right to question, the right to scrutinise and the right to dissent which enables an informed citizenry to scrutinise the actions of government. Those who are governed are entitled to question those who govern, about the discharge of their constitutional duties including in the provision of socio-economic welfare benefits. The theory that civil and political rights are subservient to socio-economic rights has been urged in the past and has been categorically rejected in the course of constitutional adjudication by this court.”
In doing so, the judgment invokes the writings of Nobel laureate Prof. Amartya Sen. For instance, the judgment relies upon Sen’s classic The Idea of Justice (Penguin Books, 2009) in holding:
“In the Indian context, Sen points out that the Bengal famine of 1943 “was made viable not only by the lack of democracy in colonial India but also by severe restrictions on reporting and criticism imposed on the Indian press, and the voluntary practice of ‘silence’ on the famine that the British-owned media chose to follow”. Political liberties and democratic rights are hence regarded as ‘constituent components’ of development.”
The judgment, while holding that there is an intrinsic relationship between development and freedom, quotes from Sen’s writings in The Country of Young Boys (Oxford University Press, 2015) as follows:
“…development cannot really be seen merely as the process of increasing inanimate objects of convenience, such as raising the GNP per head, or promoting industrialization or technological advance or social modernization.  These accomplishments are, of course, valuable – often crucially important – but their value must depend on what they do to the lives and freedoms of the people involved. For adult human beings, with responsibility for choice, the focus must ultimately be on whether they have the freedom to do what they have reason to value. In this sense, development consists of expansion of people’s freedom.”
The judgment also rejected the submission that privacy is a privilege for the few. It was held:
“[I]t is privacy which is a powerful guarantee if the state were to introduce compulsory drug trials of non-consenting men or women.  The sanctity of marriage, the liberty of procreation, the choice of a family life and the dignity of being are matters which concern every individual irrespective of social strata or economic well being.  The pursuit of happiness is founded upon autonomy and dignity.  Both are essential attributes of privacy which makes no distinction between the birth marks of individuals.”
